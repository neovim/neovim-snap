## How this repo works

1. This repo defines a time-triggered (daily) [GHA workflow](./.github/workflows/update-readme.yaml) on both its `master` and `nightly` branches.
2. The workflow pushes a [timestamp commit](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-snap/commit/752cca5b7c2d8371f54825c61d0c8ebfedbf6711)
   to "tickle" the external Snapcraft service.
3. Snapcraft fetches the `master` or `nightly` branch of this repo and processes `snap/snapcraft.yaml`.
4. Snapcraft builds Nvim (in its own, external service) as defined in `snap/snapcraft.yaml`.
    - The `snap/snapcraft.yaml` in the `nightly` branch is [slightly different](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-snap/compare/master...nightly)
      from the `master` branch. This is a limitation/requirement of Snapcraft's
      design.
